/*The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The third number is 1 + 1 = 2, the fourth is 1 + 2 = 3, the fifth is 2 + 3 = 5, and so on. In mathematical terms, this can be represented as:

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) where n > 2
This simple sequence can easily be computed using a recursive function. A recursive function is one in which the function calls itself. For example, the following function is a recursive function that computes the sum of all integers between 1 and n:

A good recursive function has three primary qualities:

It calls itself at least once.
It has an ending condition — e.g., if (n === 1), in the sum function above.
The results of each recursion are used in each step — e.g., n + sum(n - 1) uses sum(n - 1).
Write a recursive function that computes the nth Fibonacci number, where nth is an argument passed to the function.
